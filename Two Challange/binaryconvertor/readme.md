# Decimal to Binary Converter

This project is a simple **JavaScript web app** that converts decimal numbers into their **binary representation**.  
It also provides a visualization of the **call stack** during the conversion process (using recursion).

---

## Features
- Input any **decimal number**.
- Convert it to **binary** with one click.
- Displays the **binary result** in real time.
- Visualizes the **call stack** process of recursive conversion.
- Simple, beginner-friendly UI.

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Page structure.
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Conversion logic and DOM manipulation.

---

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Ensure the following files are in the same folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `srtyle.css` (⚠️ likely a typo — rename it to `style.css`)
   - `main.js`
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

---

## Example
- Input: `10`  
- Output: `1010`  

The call stack visualization will show the recursive steps of dividing by 2.
