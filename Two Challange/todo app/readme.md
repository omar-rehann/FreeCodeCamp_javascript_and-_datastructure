# Todo App Project

This project demonstrates how to use the **JavaScript localStorage API** by building a functional **Todo App**.  
The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, and all tasks are saved in the browser’s local storage so they persist after refreshing the page.

---

## Features
- **Add new tasks** with:
  - Title
  - Date
  - Description
- **Edit or update tasks** directly in the form.
- **Delete tasks** when no longer needed.
- **Data persistence** using `localStorage` (tasks remain saved after page reload).
- **Confirmation dialog** for discarding unsaved form changes.
- Responsive and simple user interface.

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Page structure.
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – DOM manipulation, form handling, and localStorage integration.

---

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Ensure the following files are in the same folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Preview
When you open the app:
1. Click **"Add New Task"** to open the task form.  
2. Enter a title, date, and description.  
3. Submit the form to see the new task displayed in the task list.  
4. Tasks are saved automatically in `localStorage` and persist after reloading the page.
