# Palindrome Checker

A simple **Palindrome Checker** built with **HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript**.  
It checks whether a given word, phrase, or sentence is a palindrome.

## Features
- Input field to enter text.
- Removes spaces, punctuation, and special characters before checking.
- Displays whether the text is a **palindrome** or not.
- Alerts if the input field is empty.
- Responsive design powered by **TailwindCSS**.

## How It Works
1. User enters text in the input field.
2. On clicking **Check**:
   - The input is converted to lowercase.
   - Non-alphanumeric characters are removed.
   - The cleaned string is compared with its reversed version.
3. The result (`is a palindrome` or `not a palindrome`) is displayed below the button.
